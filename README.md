# JournalApp
Project as part of a React course from zero

### What I learned:
- A little bit of sass (a correctly way to name files, use variables, concat html tags attributes).
- More reducers knowledge.
- Redux patron (store, combine reducers, action creators, redux thunk for async actions).
- React-redux hooks (useDispatch, useSelector).
- Firebase integration (crud with Firestore, auth with Authentication, Google and simple mail auth).
- Cloudinary integration (upload and delete images).
- Private and public routes with React Router v5.
- Unit testing with jest (enzyme, redux-mock-store).
